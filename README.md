# C-Sharp-Projects
These are some small C# projects I have made using .NET Framework.
<li>Student Database</li>
<li>Car Insurance</li>
<li>Shipping Quote</li>
<br>
<h2>Student Database</h2>
This is a simple student database console application that utilizes entity franework to create two tables in the database. The program then saves a new stdent to that database at the end.
<br>
<h2>Car Insurance</h2>
<p>This application is a basic MVC webste that takes in user's information and calculates an insurance quote based on certain circumstances. It then displays the user's new calculated quote onto an Admin view page.</p> 
<h2>Shipping Quote</h2>
<p>This is a console app that asks the user questions on their package they want to ship. The program will end if certain conditions are met like if the package weighs too much or is too large. Otherwise, a shipping quote is calculated based on the package's dimensions and weight. Then the quote is displayed to the console.</p>
